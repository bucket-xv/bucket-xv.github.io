Hi, I'm Chenhao Xu! This is my personal website. I'm an Junior undergraduate majoring in information and computing technology (Turing Class) in Peking University. I'm currently interested in cloud computing researches, especially in the areas of serverless computing. I hope my research can help improve the efficiency of cloud computing systems, helping to save energy and improve service quality.

I actively participate in the activities in Turing Class. I'm the vice president of the 2025 Turing Class Forum. Besides, I'm also serving in Student Service Corps of PKU.

## Hometown

I grow up in Shanghai, a city with a inclusive culture. Life there is always bustling and full of energy. Though currently I'm living in Beijing for my study, I hope to go back to Shanghai after my graduation.

## Favorite programming languages

As a system programmer, C/C++ is a must-have skill for me. But as we all know, C/C++ has drawbacks in runtime memory management and type safety. Rust is a new, safe and fast programming language, but I believe it is not mature enough to replace the use of C/C++ in system programming. 

In application use, I'm a big fan of Python. Python is a very friendly language, and its large standard library makes it a great tool for rapid development.

## My personal interests

- *Legends of the Three Kingdoms* (SanguoSha) is my favorite game, though I don't have much time to play it.
- I'm also currently learning flute and hope to step into the entry level soon.
- I begin going to the gym regularly since 2025.

## Projects

- [DeepSeek R1 Supplier Evaluation](https://github.com/llm-router/DeepSeekRouter)
  * Our team developed a script to evaluate the performance of DeepSeek R1's suppliers. I implemented the script on evaluation of the performance of the model in Python.
- [Thunder in Rust](https://github.com/bucket-xv/Thunder-in-Rust)
  * A small game developed in Rust. The game is a side-scrolling shooter game. You can play it [here](https://bucket-xv.github.io/Thunder-in-Rust/). You may need to be patient since about 40MB needs to be loaded.
