Hi, I'm Chenhao Xu! This is my personal website. I'm an Junior undergraduate majoring in information and computing technology (Turing Class) in Peking University. I'm currently interested in cloud computing researches, especially in the areas of serverless computing.

## My personal interests

- *Legends of the Three Kingdoms* (SanguoSha) is my favorite game, though I don't have much time to play it.
- I'm also currently learning flute and hope to step into the entry level soon.
- I begin going to the gym regularly since 2025.

## Projects

<!-- - [DeepSeek R1 Supplier Evaluation](https://github.com/llm-router/DeepSeekRouter)
  * Our team developed a script to evaluate the performance of DeepSeek R1's suppliers. I implemented the script on evaluation of the performance of the model in Python. -->
- [Thunder in Rust](https://github.com/bucket-xv/Thunder-in-Rust)
  * A small game developed in Rust. The game is a side-scrolling shooter game. You can play it [here](https://bucket-xv.github.io/Thunder-in-Rust/). You may need to be patient since about 40MB needs to be loaded.
