Hi, I'm Chenhao Xu! This is my personal website. I'm an undergraduate majoring in computer science in Peking University. I'm currently interested in computer system researches.

## My personal interests

I'm a fan of Japanese anime. I'm also currently learning flute and hope to step into the entry level soon.
