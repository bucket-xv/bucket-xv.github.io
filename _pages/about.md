Hi, I'm Chenhao Xu! This is my personal website. I'm an undergraduate majoring in computer science in Peking University. I'm currently interested in quantum computing, operating system and robotics. I welcome everyone who want to learn and study with me to contact me.

## My personal interests

I love cooking and playing badminton. I'm also a fan of Japanese anime. I'm currently learning flute and hope to step into the entry level soon.
